# Service Lists

Service lists to help with adding service references on the [picons](https://github.com/picons/picons) repository.

## What are they?

These service lists are built using ciefp's and vhannibal's motor settings. They will help you with adding the correct service references to the snp and srp index.

Just don't blindly start adding all of the references that aren't linked to a logo, since some might not be transmitting any more.

The lists are in their respective folders, ciefp and vhannibal.

## How to?

If you want to figure out how to use these, read the [contributing rules](https://github.com/picons/picons/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) on the picons repository.

## I want to build these myself. How do I do it?
